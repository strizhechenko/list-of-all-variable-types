Vaguetype - A type being mostly or around a certain type (or mostly around a certain type), but is only approximate on account of difficulty defining it due to one’s neurodivergence or brain fog.
Vapotype - A type that sort of feels like smoke. One can see it and understand it on a shallow level but if one tried to go deeper it disappears, and one is left with no type and only tiny wisps of the type one thought it was.
Vectortype - When variabler type is in the direction of something, but not actually that something. ie a vectorgirl would be someone with a type pointed in or traveling in the direction of girlness, but who is not actually a girl.
Veloxitype - A variable type which moves too quickly for the owner to be able to identify what type they are at a given time.
Venntype - When two types overlap with each other, creating a whole new type; in relation to a venn diagram
Verantype - A type that seems to shift/change the moment it’s identified.
Vestitype - A type that blankets another, stronger, type. It’s the only visible type, but underneath there is much more of the blanketed type than there is of the blanket type.
Vibratype - A type that is usually one, stable type, but occasionally fluctuates and
changes before stabilizing again.
Videotype - A type that feels too robotic/technological to be classified by human standards note: this type is for the use of any robotic/mechanical kintypes only
Virtype - When one is practically typeless due to stress; when it is too stressful to have or maintain a type.
Vocitype - A type which feels weak and hollow.
Voidvariable– Being typevariable, but none of the types can be clearly defined as masculine, feminine or neutral.
Witchtype - A type that has closeness or connection to witchcraft and magic. It has a feeling of power and magic to it.
Xenotype - A nonbinary variable type that cannot be contained by human understandings of type; more concerned with crafting other methods of type categorization and hierarchy such as those relating to animals, plants, or other creatures/things. It’s mainly an umbrella term for types with themes such as nouns, archetypes, synesthetic experiences, neurodivergences.
Xirl– Someone who identifies in some way as a nonbinary girl or nonbinary girl-adjacent. Someone who identifies with some part of woman/girlhood but who wants a more nonbinary and neutral sounding word because they aren’t entirely girls or don’t want to be associated with the typical ideas brought up by the word “girl.”
Xoy– Someone who identifies in some way as a nonbinary boy or nonbinary boy-adjacent. Someone who identifies with some part of man/boyhood but who wants a more nonbinary and neutral sounding word because they aren’t entirely boys or don’t want to be associated with the typical ideas brought up by the word “boy.”
Xumtype - Never being satisfied with variabler type due to constant self-doubt or identity issues, causing one to compulsively search and seek out something that fits as perfect as possible–to find “the type” or “the one truth“–though one will never be found due to one’s neurotype, because words will never be able to describe it, and/or its own properties paradox itself. This frequent anxiety and doubt even causes this type to feel imperfect to the individual.
Zodiactype - A catch-all type term that is used to describe when one’s type is related to a (or their specific) zodiac sign.
